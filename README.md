### Summary

Overall, it appears that females account for roughly 1/3 of the ridership that males do.  When considering the further implementation of the bike-share programs, it may be beneficial to appeal to males as that is who tends to utilize bike-shares more often.  It may also be beneficial to consider how females may be better marketed to in an effort to increase their ridership.

It is also quite clear that ridership is highest on the weekdays during the morning and evening commutes.  Saturdays have a fairly higher ridership noted from about mid-morning continuing through the evening.  Sunday notes a slightly less ridership though still higher than weekdays and looks to pickup pace when it can be assumed many are done with church or during the mid-morning time frame.

When considering adding further analysis, it may be enlightening to consider expanding the gender information further and adding Birth Year to ascertain the age groups and their ridership trends.  It may also be beneficial to further analyze the Start and End Station IDs to determine what increases the likelihood of ridership at a given station.
